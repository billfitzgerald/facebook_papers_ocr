ST THURSDAY, NOVEMBER 15, 2018 - READING TIME: 4 MINUTES @

I'm not in Comms, but I'm going to to go out on a limb and say that these last few weeks have

been brutal for Facebook, Inc. in the press (See: here, here, here and here (oh, and here, an

ee I

exception)). I've been here a while so my friends typically don't bother me a ton with
Facebook-related articles, but over the last few days, I've had four different friends and

family members ask me about recent news..

family members ask me about recent news.

Having spent the last seven years of my life working at places that have gotten a lot of media

attention (5.2 years combined at Facebook plus two presidential campaigns), I wanted to

share my approach to reading tough news stories that I've learned over the years, View this as

one person's perspective, but I share all of this in the hopes that when negative and tough
articles get published, we let our Comms team do their jobs — push back and correct details

and narrative, as needed — and we focus on understanding what we can learn from external

criticism and how we can make our products and our company better.

Three things:

synopsis of the story or an Axios Be Smart summary (brevity is not always smart, sorry. O
or the most critical part of the story excerpted in the comments section of an FYI post.

Read the original story from the original source. Twice.

e Second, internalize what you're reading and try not to immediately jump to 1) it's
FAKE NEWS, 2) they got this small detail wrong, they're totally wrong), or 3) THEY
HAVE A VENDETTA AGAINST US. We all have a responsibility to learn from the
criticism we get and collectively take responsibility that we're the largest platform

platform in the world - jumping into defense mode too quickly prevents us from doing

that. I personally am glad that the press is holding us to account (note: this isn't me

As you write, it's easy to get caught up in little details that are painted unfairly -- and there are definitely some things in

responsibility to do better. | especially challenge my colleagues who work on product teams to hold ourselves to higher

ee Unless we work there we won't know for sure if the editorial side is skewing their

coverage or not, but NYT's steep declines in revenue impact the editorial side’s compensation, benefits, bonuses,
morale and optimism, etc. So challenges on the business side definitely impact those on the editorial side and may be

considered in their coverage.

Another factor to consider is influence. Before FB, people got news from NYT and other similar sources. Now a lot of
people get news from other sources through FB and Twitter. In some ways, FB is limiting the reach and therefore

influence that the NYT editorial side has on audiences.

Lf think you're referring to at least some of the discussions we've had. My perspective is better

expressed as, "how [people] are [unreliable] and can't be trusted any time". | don't single out the press, or criticism
of Facebook, and | don't consider most people liars. The problem is that as humans we never have the full picture.
Our own lives are these insanely crafted adventures which make perfect sense and everyone else has it wrong. But

that's how we all think and we can't all be right (or wrong!)

7 a me clarify, because short snippishness isn't helpful and | apologize for that -

lf it were just one or two people saying these things, | would not be concerned, and | would talk to them directly - as

we did yesterday, Dean.

| see a high number of people here expressing enormous negativity towards the press that | do not feel is fair or
earned, and demanding enormously higher standards from them than from us - standards impossible for anyone to

 

meet.

lf you're not in agreement that anyone is saying anything like that or there's any cause for alarm, that’s fine - we have
enormously different value systems at the very least and that can’t be solved in a single discussion in a platform

that's not great for nuanced discussion. | want to express appreciation for a: thoughts here and move on.

p po It is so earned. Here's a couple of patently false articles from supposedly reputable NYT about FB:

https://www.nytimes.com/.../jobs-facebook-computer...
https://www.nytimes.com)/.../users-abandon-facebook.html

In both cases it's been pointed out that both recruiting is doing just fine (if not better) and hashtag deletefacebook
hasn't translated to actual deletions.

The latest NYT is loaded with misogynist and anti-Semitic wording, language | pointed out to you in chat and others
spotted as well: https://fb.facebook.com/.../permalink/1918693318166163/

 

Stamos called the NYT on the carpet over this and got one of the writers to concede:
https://twitter.com/ScottShaneNY T/status/106321214935/7596672

But it doesn't even have to be about FB that the media gets patently false. Good news is simply buried by traditional
media because it doesn't sell clicks. You never see a headline that reads, "Crime has fallen 400% in the last 20 years”

but that headline would be completely true (http://www.pewresearch.org/.../ft_16-11-16_crime trend-2/) far thie fact
alone, | consider the press to be asleep at their jobs and complicit with a panicked society. Chats
