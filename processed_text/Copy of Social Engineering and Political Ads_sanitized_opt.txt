ices team of dedicated product, engineering, and design Facebookers are tackling the most

: glaring problems with what happened: increasing verification procedures for US political
advertisers, exposing the funding source of political ads, making active ads available
regardless of targeting, and publicly archiving political ads as they run. We are taking initial
steps to prioritize civility above other objectives in this space, but we can go even further—
use the existing framework for how our ads system works to empower people with

information:

1) Allow political education and campaign
funders to more clearly self-declare their
financial support for specific messages.

Social Engineering and Political Ads

How to use the influential power of ads to empower people to make better-informed

 

decisions about political ads, have well thought-out views and be more aware of dubious or

unreliable sources.

In the Facebook Ads world, we seek to make meaningful connections between people and
businesses. And more specifically EEE publicly declared our advertising principles

last November. One of those principles reads:

Advertising should be safe and
civil; it should not divide or
discriminate.

e e same time, polarization is an important marketing strategy made manifest in the
messaging, and targeting of ads. We don’t want to discourage segmentation

sses starting with a particular niche is a prerequisite for entering growth mode.

informative political ads over divisive and

hateful ones.

The challenge here is a technical and design challenge, but not an insurmountable one. How
can we use aggregate feedback and/or modeling to give ads that inform users about a
particular side of a political question an advantage in delivery? We stand to benefit on user
sentiment about ads and to promote quality revenue. This effort would also give upstart
political advertisers with high-quality content access to ad inventory and address valid

criticisms that divisive ad messages are cheap and easily spread.

The largest part of Facebook's optics problem with political ads is the lack of public and
regulatory awareness of proactive and reactive efforts taking place at the company. We can
and should highlight major victories in political ad enforcement, good actors making our
platform better and ongoing efforts we're committed to bringing online. We have a
transparency report— https://transparency.facebook.com/government/ —for exposing the

We have started on the long journey to rebuild trust and have both users and governments
regain confidence in the integrity of ads served on our platform. This is an opportunity to
manifest our stated priorities, be transparent without penalizing good actors and help

external observers properly scrutinize if we live up to our commitments or not.
