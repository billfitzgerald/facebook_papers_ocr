Being a new, female user is not a great experience in most emerging
markets

| recently published a note about how we do not survey new users in TRIPS but should since
they appear to have more negative experiences. At the suggestion of Ravi lyer | included a cut

by country and, at = s suggestion, | also included a gender cut. The
results are stark.

In the US, women with <30d tenure on platform give ~30% more USI than men. In most
European countries the gap is closer to 10%. In ID the gap is 170%. IN, BR, AR, PH, NG and ZA

also have gaps of over 100%.

for Congress

One possible explanation is that women simply give more USI overall in these countries and it
has nothing to do with tenure. The other plot below shows the relative USI ratio between the
first month on the platform and months 9-12. That plot shows that, while there are overall
gender effects, there is also a tenure-specific factor. For instance, women in ID give 3.3x more
USI in their first month than in months 9-12, but for men the ratio is only 2.2x.

| have not performed this analysis on civic-specific content, but | suspect we will see a similar
(or worse) trend. Especially since we already have evidence that women are participating less in
civic discussions. | do not have specific remediation recommendations at this point, but would
be interested in collaborating further.

- |'d love to consider a workstream toward improving the
onboarding experience of women in lower literacy countries with a goal of reducing
the disparities in the above graphs, perhaps by creating better initial sources to
follow.

Unlike many workstreams, we have a readily made metric already, though some
have pointed out that a part of the above could be due to people signing up fake
accounts to report others. Still, this converges with other findings co i note
on how phone shops connect people to sources iii work on gendered
harassment orf notes on how easy it is to rabbit hole in
recommendations) such that I'm inclined to believe at least some of this is due to
actually bad onboarding experiences for women in these markets. And there is an
easy growth argument to be made for doing something about this as well as
allowing bad experiences for new users seems like a poor long term growth tactic.

BE Maybe something you're already doing, but gender specific B&H
can sometimes be caught better by the sexually suggestive classifier vs.
B&H. e.g.
https://fb.workplace.com/groups/655489201588520/permalink/9164725
48823516]. Perhaps you could try to bootstrap such a classifier leveraging
comments reported for B&H by women that are non-violating but have
certain words? Or maybe there is a way to leverage green lantern/CIRD in this
direction?

Ravi lyer | wonder if looking at USI w/o filtering further would actually be
informative. It's possible that negative interactions actually are not caught
very well but our current classifiers. Probably depends on how overt the
harassment is.

yes Rxactly - a lot of perceived harassment is explicitly non-
violating per our current intervention standards. So it's very likely that people
are seeing harassment which is decreasing their experience quality and

‘potentially driving them off the platform that our classifiers do not identify as
actionable or even borderline. This only goes double for markets and
languages that we have poor or no coverage in for those classifieds.

a we've definitely looked for India, looking into unwanted friending, comments,
messaging etc for women. There's lot of correlative and some experimental
evidence | believe between some of the work on locked profile and maybe
even some live friending tests. are there any tests we can share?

= There are quite a lot of correlational analysis linking integrity to retention In
terms of causational evidence, 2 things | think of is (1) locked profiles led to
DAP win, and (2) positive retention gain in our friending integrity holdout
(link).
Friending integrity for India female is one of the major areas in our India
strategy. We are testing different integrity filters on male to female friending
requests. We are also building a survey-based "uncomfortable friending
classifier" to demote sketchy friending. But these are all still WIP, and we will
have something to share later this quarter.
