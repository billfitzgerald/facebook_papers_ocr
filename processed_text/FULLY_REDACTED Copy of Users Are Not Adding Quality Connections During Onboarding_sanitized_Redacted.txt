onboarding churn early.

Context

First impression matters - for many, onboarding on MK is the users’ first encounter with the MK
app and its setups (see Appendix for more info). The current flow can consist of three parts for
parents: 1) set up the basic bio info 2) find possible contacts 3) opt-ins and privacy policy
reviews.

In addition to being a long process (40 screens from account creation to activation), various
UXR studies have shown that the suggested contacts (adults and kids) are not relevant for new

users (UXR Study b’ UXR Study by and parents have trouble finding specific

contacts to add during onboarding.

Data findings are consistent with the UXR sessions in the sense that the recommendation
during onboarding is overwhelming and inconsistent for new users.

No Relevant Contacts to Add for 17% Users,
Resulting in the “KOAO” Kids

10% CTR Means That 90% of the Suggested Contacts are
Potentially Irrelevant

We are showing too many suggested contacts than users wish to add: among the 152K users
we looked at who joined MK recently, the CTR for suggested contacts on both the “Friends and
Family” and “Kids” friending page is only fairly low: for adults, the average CTR is 13%, and for
kid, 12%. *

As a standard smartphone screen shows around 8-9 candidates on one screen without
scrolling, the aforementioned CTR translates to roughly 1 user on every screen as
relevant/worth adding. Here, CTR is used as a proxy measurement for suggestion quality (see
more below for using connections with WAT as a measure for contact quality). While we do not
have a benchmark for what constitutes an “ideal” CTR for suggested contacts in the MK
onboarding use case, we risk at losing new MK parents’ trust if we suggest the “wrong” contact

(which is very different from me sitting at home and scrolling through a long list of recommended Oo
restaurants to order from on Doordash).

1 in 6 Users Added No Connections During Onboarding

UXR research shows that in general, parents are finding 0-5 “ # i
onboarding. Data estimates that around 17% of the activated accounts did not send any “add”
requests during onboarding to either the adult suggestions or the kid suggestions, meaning that
these kids will land in their inbox with zero connections other than their parents. Further
breakdown shows that close to half (42%) did not “add” any adult users during onboarding.

The table shows that for the 42% users did not find any relevant adults to add during
onboarding, and this is most likely because the suggested adult contacts consist primarily of the
parents’ close FB friends. Quality adult connections for a kid user are likely a family member
(grandpas, grandmas, older cousins etc), but they are either not on FB yet or somehow not
surfaced during onboarding.

What's even more concerning is that about 25% users did not add any kid connections during
onboarding. It is possible that these are younger kids without many established kid connections

already on MK or users who are coming to the MK organically, so the cold start problem for
these users are even worse.

KOAO Kids Are 28% Less Retained on Day 45

 

 

 

 

 

Those who are KOAO (no adult or kid added during onboarding) retain significally worse than
their counterparts, with at least one adult or at least one kid added during onboarding. The delta
for retention between the KOAO and K+A+ (having at least one adult add and one kid add during
onboarding) folks are close to 30% by Day 45.
At Day 45 (about one month and half since activation), only 64% of the KOAO group remain
MAU, suggesting that these users can churn easily because they have trouble expanding their
network beyond Day 0 of activation.
Looking at the table below, users with low connection networks on day 0 retain much worse

Addressing Cold Start During Onboarding

For new users, If we believe that one of the main goals of onboarding should be helping users
discover quality connections, then surfacing quality connections during onboarding is key.
Assuming that we don’t completely change the onboarding flow for suggested contacts, how do
we ensure that users have the right setup from the get-go?

Explicitly Uprank Inviter/Inviter Kids + Let Parents Search for
Non-FB Friends’ Kids During Onboarding

Context:

Current “Add Kids” page will only show MK kids of the source parents’ FB friends, which means
that new MK parents will have a hard time finding the kids of their inviters’ kids (if they have
been invited on the FB platform before) unless they are already FB friends with the target
parent.

Suggestion:

1) We figure out a way to up!

parents are FB friends.

2) We incorporate search to allow new parents to search for a specific kid and nudge them

to do so, especially if the new users were invited offline (in the case that we don’t have
data linking the inviter and invitee). Note here that compared to pre-Covid era,

Additional notes: . . ; -
1) Let's not overwhelm new parents with a long list of their coworkers'/FB friends’ kids. As
Chloe pointed out, compared to the pre-COVID era, the number of “suggested kids” has
increased. It might make more sense now to have a “search” feature.

Encourage Parents to Search for the Adults Connections

If 43% of the users onboarded have no adult connections on activation date, then we need to
rethink how we define a “quality” adult connection for a young kid. Perhaps we should lean less
on the parents’ FB graph to make a recommendation for kids.

A radical approach would be to remove the suggested adult connections list and only show the
search bar. Let's say that the parent has an adult contact in mind for the kid to chat with

(perhaps family members, grandparents, etc), they can easily find those family members using
Search, so that we still give them the impression that the app is “safe.”

UXR sessions show that at the moment, parents are not using search during onboarding much,
which is very likely given that we provide them with a long list of suggested connections to
scroll. However, if we give parents more options to find the right contact from the

Discussion Points

We would like to end this note with some philosophical questions around onboarding and what
we want the users to get out of onboarding:

14. For those coming to the app for the first time, how do we balance high-intent and
low-intent friending/invites?”
a. We know that kids’ graphs are different from their parents, so how can we help
surface better connections?
b. Do we/should we recommend so many adult connections?
2. Different use cases for different parents, can we personalize the onboarding flow to
match those different use cases?
a. For instance, can we ask
i. Parents to tell us whom they allow their kids to talk to?
ii. Kids to tell us who they want to talk to?
3. Can we make the onboarding process a shared experience between parents and kids so
that more quality connections can be established from Day 0?

Appendix

Redacted for Congress
‘What is “onboarding?”

Most commonly, we use the word “onboarding” to refer to account creation to account activation
flow. “Account creation” occurs when the parent creates a new kid account (on either PD on the
FB app, or on the MK app), and “account activation” occurs when the kid lands in the inbox (see
the thread tiles) and becomes a MAU for the remainder of that month.

There are four main goals of the current onboarding flow that the users can take:
1. Parent: basic info (name, birthday, add a photo)
1. Parent: choose contacts:
a. “Choose kid to chat with” (add another kid, then Parent B needs to approve; if
with the same creator aka sibling kids, then automatically added)
b. “Finds parents of their friends to chat with” (FB-MK parents not shown)
c. “Choose adult to chat with” (Parent A’s FB friends, automatically added, less
engagement)
2. Parent: opt-ins
a. FoF opt-in

How the “add” friending works during onboarding

Before the opt-in screens, parent users go through one “invites” screen and two “friending”
screens to add relevant contacts for their kids (screenshots below).

Suggested Kid Contacts: Kid users with the same account creator (such as siblings) are
automatically added, whereas sending a request to other kids will need to target kids’ parental

approval.

Suggested Parent Contacts: Parent contact suggestions are only of the parent user's Facebook
friends, and the target will be automatically added and show up in the kids’ inbox.

Maybe this is obvious, but | do want to clearly spell it out:
The main challenge for K2K connection is probably inventory not ranking.

The connotation of the conclusion and recommendation here seems to be that we

have a large inventory of kids to choose from, and we aren't surfacing the high-
quality ones during onboarding.

The "contact suggestions" during onboarding isn't so much "suggestions" as "the
only kids whose existence you can see". Those are typically kids of your FB friends;

and we know for a fact that parent's FB graph is distinctly different from their kid's
friend graph.

Fundamentally to solve the inventory problem, we need:

1. Growth! Given our market penetration of ~25%, it's highly likely (75%) that your
kid's friends simply aren't using the app.

2. Visibility Expansion. Parents aren't FB friends. We need FoF, School and
potentially other creative solutions.

Those aren't really problems we can solve in onboarding.
Our hands are tied in how much we can do in onboarding.

rely on their FB network to keep recommending potential suggestions.

A separate note on inventory: just because we have (or will have in the future)

a Thanks so that's a good context to keep in mind.

Some potentially controversial take on this "recommendation/suggestion"
topic:

suggestions yield the highest value when we have data to know what we
should recommend. For many apps, this means asking a question on what the
user want during onboarding ("pick three genres of music or types of book
you're interested", or Netflix "tell us what you like to watch"). Compared other
apps' approach with MK's approach, we might be a bit too confident on what
we can recommend to new users.

Having more of a hybrid approach and asking users what they want from the
start might help us in the long-run and result in the highest impact in
retention. Maybe that's something we can keep in mind if we were to redesign
the onboarding flow in the future.

nothing to do with your interests, but everything to do with your actual IRL

That's the main reason we rely on the parent graph as a major signal to start
with right?

That said, | don't remember, if a user was invited to the app, do we use the

PY definitely agree there is value in the suggestions

and in a high intent friending search. Since the data show the most friending
happens at onboarding and is the most time efficient way for parents to add
contacts for their child, | think there is value to get contacts added to the
child's graph to get started but what I'm finding in the qualitative research is
those contacts (mostly adults) are not on the kid's IRL friend graph. After a
month of using the app, they churn from the app without IRL friends. BFF
research shows those IRL friends are from school, church, neighborhood, and
extracurricular activities (e.g., Girl Scouts, dance, soccer). Early insights from
the New User Journey 2nd round of interviews is that users are using the
suggested list to find target parents to invite to the app. The use case is that
parents are already FB friends. The user experience to scroll through a long
list of suggestions is not ideal becauses users are reporting its not organized
in any systematic way. When scrolling through such a long list, target parent
can easily be skipped, so we do need an easier way to add high intent
friending cases (allow parents to filter down the list). If they are not FB friends
with the other parent, the source parent does not initiate friending at all
because of the common misconception you need to FB friends to make a k2k
connection for their child.

Suggestion-based connections added during onboarding are low quality: over
two thirds contacts added during onboarding do not lead to a WAT in 7 days,
and close to 90% of the contacts shown during onboarding are irrelevant.

Another thought on this - we've heard from Research many times that parent's
perception of who their kids' friends are can be very different from who the kids are
actually wanting to chat with.

So there's also a scenario where the suggestions might be high-quality as far as the
PARENT is concerned, but low quality for the kid's likelihood of chatting. Of course
it's still not great for K2KWAT purposes, but we should also think about how likely it
can be for contact suggestions to lead to WAT is parents are the actors to begin
with. FWIW, the parents are still intentionally sending those requests, so they're still
"quality" from that perspective. (| am not at all arguing that we actually are good in
quality now. Just stating that "quality" is definitionally dependent, so we should
precise on what we consider quali: - | think this is your shared meta-purpose of
the post anyway g) )

The 90% shown being irrelevant number is a better judge of quality from the aoe
“likelihood to act" perspective, but also a weird metric (ie. easy to manipulate that

number by just showing more or less people in the list). One click deeper here can

be interesting to see how many "high coefficient" suggestions we show, and what

the "send rate" for those users are. (ie. are we ranking incorrectly, or don't have the
appropriate people available to rank in the first place)

PYMK for my personal FB account, for example, is pretty "bad" nowadays because |
have a stable friend graph, so would have a low relevance rate for me. At most I
might have 1 suggestion | would consider friending, so | might have 95%
suggestions being irrelevant. Cold-start graphs have a same potential problem. But

this looks very different for other people, and doesn't necessarily mean it's bad
either.

have a lot of fake accounts / adult accounts labeled as kids, which can degrade trust
significantly. cc

WAT becomes a component of that definition.
PYMK might be the closest example here, but we should still bear in mind the
differences between MK and FB/MSGR for the purpose of the comparison:
adults have a much bigger graph and broader definition for "relevant" friends
that they should add. On the contrary, kids have a much smaller circle and and
thus the threshold for what can even be recommended should be higher as a
result.

From BFF research, we know that parents are aware of their
child's best friends and know about their child's IRL friend graph. Parents do
not add these connections because they are not offered as suggested kid or
adult contacts so then parents make a best guess from the suggested
contacts to guage who their child wants to talk to. | don't think we can say
these connections are high quality from the parent perspective but just a good
faith effort from parents to give their child someone to talk to on MK. | think
the main point to hit home is that these irrelevant connections do not keep
kids on the app and they churn when their friends are not using MK. From the
New User Journey 2nd round interviews, we are seeing that these non-IRL
friend connections do not keep kids on the platform. Kids keep telling | would
use the app more if my friends were on it.

FYI - Parents think adding contacts at onboarding is the most efficient way to
add contacts for their child. They struggle to figure out how add friends for
their child post-onboarding. CC:

|_| Sorry for arriving late to the party here. Onboarding tries to solve two problems:
high intent friending and low/medium intent friending. We're not doing a great job
with either.

High Intent: search is key. If they already know who they want to add, but we're
having them go through a huge list, that’s not very motivating. Especially if they
can't find that specific person.

Low intent: what makes it particularly hard here is that we can’t use FoF in its pure
form because the kid has no friends yet. We could increase the candidate set even
more here by allowed friends of friends through the parent graph, but these are
probably going to be even lower quality.

propaply going to pe even lower quality.

At the end of the day, this is a very tricky problem, because High Quality
Connections usually are the ones in which parents are not connected (school for
example), and during Onboarding, parents can only select kids through their graph.

Long term, | think we should focus on:

- Onboarding should nail High Intent Friending. When parents are creating new
accounts, the kids they have in mind should be super easy to find and add.

- Post Onboarding, we need to make high quality suggestions immediately to the
kid, NOT the parent. That will likely happen mostly through School, not FoF. We
should also upsell to kids that they can send a QR code to connect with their best
friend, for High Intent.

In other words, we shouldn't expect to get a ton of high quality connections in
Onboarding itself because they'll be from the parent graph. We should do more post
Onboarding so the kid is empowered to find friends for him/herself.

aE have we done a funnel analysis on the 40 steps of the onboarding flow itself? where

ppl drop off or seem to get confused? are they sending invites and ppl just not
accepting? etc etc

| Are the data specific to MK onboarding or PD onboarding is also included?

18% of the new users added zero adult or kid contacts during onboarding and
land in the inbox with no connection other than their parents

Wondering how many of the 18% are likely adults(https://fourl.com/qk8uznxa)?

Agree there definitely room to improve but just want to make sure we are not
focusing on people such as parents who are just checking out the app

a | looked at MK onboarding and excluded the likely adults from the analysis.
Yes - | think for the activation efforts for this half, it also makes sense to only
target those who are more likely to be real kid accounts.
