Are local groups bad for engagement?

| | TUESDAY, OCTOBER 15, 2019 - READING TIME: 7 MINUTES @&

In this note I present four loosely connected results stemming from one analysis:

1. Engagement with groups has clear geographical patterns
2. In the US - city dwellers are less engaged in groups
3. Overall, in the US, demographics is a good predictor of group engagement

3. Overall, in the US, demographics is a good predictor of group engagement

4. The number of local groups near a person is negatively correlated with

Engagement with groups has clear geographical patterns

I've started my analysis with a goal of finding sub-populations underserved by the current
groups ecosystem. My thinking was that by finding such clusters of low engagement, we
might be able to create or promote the creation of groups dedicated to those populations.
Hopefully, such a concentrated effort will be more effective in identifying inventory-gaps.

The groups connect team segmented the population of FB users in the following way:

1. Luddites - People that are not active in groups, and are unlikely to become active even
if we tried our hardest. Technically - people that are not members of any active group,
having 17<=2 and either don't have a profile picture or have joined Facebook more than
a year ago.

2. No - People that are not members of any active group (and are not Luddites) °

3. Light group users- People that are members of 1 to 10 active groups, and their group
128 is no more than 7 days.

2. No - People that are not members of any active group (and are not Luddites)

3. Light group users- People that are members of 1 to 10 active groups, and their group

128 is no more than 7 days.
4. Medium group users - Best defined as people that are not any of the other segments

5. Heavy group users - People that are members of at least one active group, and their
group 128 is at least 14 days.

With that definition, I filtered out all Luddites, and plotted in the next map the other
segments. The more red the color, the more likely that the people living in that “pixel” to be
in either the Medium or Heavy segments.

It’s not super surprising to see that groups-engagement, like overall FB-engagement is very
much dependent on geography. Still, it’s interesting to note that the effort led by the groups
connect team, to push NO/Light users into more engaged segments, means as a matter of

fact, focusing on some specific countries.

In the US - city dwellers are less engaged in groups

Focusing on the US, one thing is apparent, even in the map above - people living near the
coast are less engaged with groups in comparison to people living in the heartland. Zooming

in on Texas reveals another interesting pattern:

Probability of engagement in groups vs. user density

This brings up some questions and a few possible explanations. J for example is working
on a more substantial analysis linking group engagement with social capital. I won't try to
fully explain why people in big cities are less engaged with groups. I'll note though that user
density is also negatively correlated with overall 128 at Facebook and likelihood of being

This brings up some questions and a few possible explanations. Ho: example is working

density is also negatively correlated with overall 128 at Facebook and likelihood of being

Overall, in the US, demographics is a good predictor of
group engagement

Given that user-density is correlated with group engagement, a natural follow-up question is

 

how much can we predict group-engagement given only user demographics features. Or
more succinctly - can we predict group engagement without using any group
related features?

Surprisingly the answer for US based users is yes. Given only user demographics
features, group engagement and MP status can be predicted with high accuracy.
This result (which was known to some people) is interesting on its own - it suggests that the
efficacy of our efforts to make people more engaged, or to create more meaningful people, is
somewhat limited by demographics.

Specifically we define two classification tasks:

1. Is a US user in the High/Medium user segments (versus the No and Light ones, ignoring
Luddites)?

2. Does a US user have a meaningful connection with any group - that is, are they
meaningful people.

Specifically we define two classification tasks:

1. Isa US user in the High/Medium user segments (versus the No and Light ones, ignoring

Luddites)?

2. Does a US user have a meaningful connection with any group - that is, are they

meaningful people.

As features I use the following - 11, 17, 128, number of friends, nearby user density, facebook

age, age, gender and mobile OS. Note again that I don’t include any features related to
groups, like “number of groups that is user is member of”. I fit a GBDT for the two tasks,

without any fine tuning or metaparameter search (just sklearn’s defaults).

When predicting user segment, the model gets AUC=0.81, meaning given two random users,
one is highly engaged with groups, one is not, we'll be able to identify which is which 81% of
the times. The accuracy is 73%, while a constant model would get 51%. L28 and friend count

are the most important features.

Predicting MP is a bit harder, but we still get AUC=0.79. The accuracy of the model is 74%,
while a constant model would get a 67%.

The number of local groups near a person is negatively
correlated with engagement

Finally, let’s look at whether more local groups is better for engagement. Obviously, given

groups, but users are less engaged.

To control for user-density and other demographics factors, I use the following procedure:

1. Take the classifier described in the last section and for a new set of users predict

“baseline” engagement probability, without knowledge of the number of nearby local

groups.
2, Train a new classifier (logistic regression), using the baseline probability from (1) and
the (log) number of active local groups near the user, trying to predict engagement.

3. Observe the weight the model gives to the number of active local groups.

[technical note - by active local groups I mean public or closed, non BSG, groups whose p75
distance from their centroid is less than 25KM, and having at least 3 distinct users posting or
commenting in the last week. We're counting how many such groups are within 25KM of the

user,

In both the user-segment task, and in the MP prediction task, the number of nearby local
groups is actually having a negative weight, which is significantly below 0. Obviously, I’m not
claiming that more local groups cause less engagement with groups overall - this is just a

correlation. But, I am now skeptical of any efforts to increase the number of 1 Chats

3. The incremental local groups are not the types of local group:

a :: interesting insights! Couple of thoughts

* onuser density being negatively correlated with engagement: similar to [EES comment above, but maybe
these communities are engaging in real life more easily, meaning that they don't have to engage online as much.

* Given that population density in rural areas is much lower, does having the same threshold for local groups (p75 to
centroid of 25km) make sense? These groups would probably be a lot smaller, making it less likely users will engage

to people. (le. the problem is lower down.in the

s that people have demand for (this is the hypothesis |

a. my second point: one way of seeing if the centroid difference needs to be changed would be by
comparing high school class groups in rural areas vs urban. Since school assignment in the U.S is mostly based on
geographic proximity, the ratio of the average distance between the two could be a good proxy for how much wider
the "local" radius needs to be in different parts of the country.

| | that's a cool idea*! | think though to keep this analysis sim)
ple, it suffices to count local
groups with two radiuses, and allow the model “choose” according to user density.
