Identifying pathways to harmful
groups about nudity

Akey component of the Drebbel system is to discover pathways to harmful entities a user might
take when engaging with our recommendation surfaces. As part of this effort, we have built a
workflow to identify entities that act as gateways to recognized harmful entities. In this note, we
apply this. workflow to focus on groups considered harmful due to nudity and sexual activity.

* Gateway groups for nudity/sexual activity harm seem to facilitate eventual connections
to non-rec Groups. We should consider interventions that are either targeted towards
users in these gateway groups, or at the entity-level in order to prevent these
downstream connections from happening.

* Specific interventions we propose include: GYSJ seed filtering, invite friction and entity-

level demotion. We are working with the Deamplification team to pursue experiments
both at entity-level and at the edge-level.

* We should stress however, that not al/ gateway groups are potentially problematic in
and of themselves; we should use other signals of harm (e.g., number of members

flagged as non-rec, group demotion score etc.) in conjunction to determine the ones
that we want to consider enforcing on more aggressively.

Quick refresher on Gateway groups

As part of studying pathways to harmful entities, we wanted to explore the question “Are there
groups that facilitated and increased the probability of a user joining harmful groups?” We call
such groups gateway groups as they often lead people to join harmful groups.

Here, we provide a brief overview of how we detect gateway groups. For thorough details see this
note.

To answer the question, we first build a classifier that, given a list of groups joined by an user, can
predict with high accuracy whether the user will end up joining a given target harmful group. For a
particular user, after every group they join, we evaluate the probability of them joining a har mful
group in the future. If this probability spikes after a group join, that is a sign that the group just
joined might be a gateway. If this spike happens for multiple users, after joining the same group,
we identify it as a gateway group.

For this note, we used as the set of target groups those based in US with at least 60 content-level
strikes for nudity and sexual activity in the month of March (source table:

eau_nudity_sexual_activity_strike_harm_source: integrity).

still a big vector.

Results
© 10.77% of users who joined one of the top 100 gateway groups (ranked by highest
gateway score) we identify, eventually joined a non-rec group through exposure to
GYSJ vs. 8.78% of those who had no exposure to GYSJ
Mitigations

* We should consider filtering out the top gateway groups from GYSJ seeds

Are gateway groups being targeted by "super-inviters"?

Hypotheses

¢ Super inviters (defined as those who sent > 50 invites to our collection of target
groups) constitute a big source of invitations from gateway groups

* Users who are featured in PYMI invitations join more non-rec groups

« Users in gateway groups join more non-rec groups through PYMK (friending > invites
> join a harmful group)

Results

* 35% of invites (~730K) to these harmful groups went to members after they joined one
of the top 100 gateway groups. Of these 730K invites, 20% came from “super-inviters”.

e * We did not see evidence supporting the PYMI hypothesis; roughly equal fractions of
users between control and testing in the long-term PYMI holdout eventually joined non-
Tec groups.

* We did not see evidence supporting the PYMI hyp:
holdout eventually joined non-

users between control and testing in the long-term PYMI
rec groups.
* We also did not see enough evidence to suggest that PYMK influences connections to
harmful groups either through featuring more users as candidates or showing them
more friend recommendations

Mitigations
* Introduce feature limits on super-inviters, e.g., number of bulk invites that can be sent
out by super-inviters. We can make this more targeted by focusing only on invites going
out to users in a gateway group but this is a more intrusive enforcement and would
require more thought about how we communicate this intervention to the actor.

Correlation with Non-rec groups

Hypotheses

¢ Gateway groups are themselves good predictors of non-rec groups

Results

* Out of the top 100 gateway groups for the nudity harm target list, 47 are correctly
labeled non-rec; importantly, 42 of these were labeled as non-rec after the workflow
ran. Although the model is not intended for predicting overall non-rec signal (the model
is trained on a specific subset of harm strikes — nudity & sexual activity — and so
would miss out on groups determined non-rec for other harms), this is nonetheless a

strong indicator of how important the model could be as a signal upstream.
