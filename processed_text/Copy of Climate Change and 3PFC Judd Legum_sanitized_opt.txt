FULL TEXT
Ms. Thorning-Schmidt, *

In the four years you served Denmark as Prime Minister, you saw the effects of CO2 on climate
change first hand. You made this dire challenge central to your tenure; you took action and
asked other leaders to do the same. You made bold and ambitious commitments to achieve
400% renewable energy. You were celebrated for affirming the urgent necessity of acting to
halt climate change.

Above all, you told the world that climate change is not “an opinion.” It is fact.

Facebook is allowing the spread of climate misinformation to flourish, unchecked, across the
globe, Instead of heeding the advice of independent scientists and approved fact-checkers
from Climate Feedback, Facebook sided with fossil fuel lobbyists by allowing the CO2 Coalition
to take advantage of a giant loophole for “opinion” content. The loophole has allowed climate
denial to fester by labeling it “opinion,” and thus, avoiding the platform's fact-checking
processes.

Facebook knows how to take action against misinformation. When COVID-19 denial took hold
on the platform, it was forcibly shut down because Facebook understood that the spread of
COVID-19 misinformation could cause imminent physical harm to the health and well-being of
Facebook users. Climate denial and misinformation are also deadly. By allowing climate

4 misinformation to go unchecked, Facebook is actively putting the health and well-being of our
Nation's most vulnerable low-income communities and communities of color at risk.

You and the Oversight Board must step in and enact the same standard for the denial of
as you did for COVID-19 misinformation.

he must get the facts right on climate, and refused to acknowledge that climate denial on his

Is there something wrong with us having an open platform where people can post
arguments for either side of an issue and then people make up their own minds
for themselves?

if there's a group that wants to post the earth is flat, should they not be allowed
to? If people want to post about the story of creation from the Old Testament,
should it be censored because science says evolution occurred otherwise? The
list could go on and on...

false is relative when everyone cherry picks their

Anthropogenic climate change is causing real harm, and beliefs to the
contrary perpetuate it, increasing harm further because it discourages
the large scale action we need by politicians who listen to the people

The third party fact checker for that article was by people that do
climate change work for a living. While they have ’§Jood experience
maybe, they also have a conflict of interest in that they make their
livings arguing the opposite viewpoint.

If anthropomorphic climate change is doing real harm then should we
ban or censor all who engage in it? Should we cut out advertising for
the major corporations that contribute to it since they are doing
significant physical harm to people?

I'm not arguing the effects of climate change. | simply think that an
open forum for discussion allows for education on the matter. And that
you educate, not censor, to create real, lasting, and meaningful
change in people and society.

Climate scientists are the experts on the science and best suited to
fact check it. Just like epidemiologists, virologists, and other experts
are best suited to evaluate data about coronavirus.

If scientists and fact checkers end up politicized, the mistakes will be
public and they will eventually lose their authority, just like the doctors
who were paid off to claim smoking didn’t cause cancer, and leaded
gas wasn't a health problem - very damaging misinformation
campaigns that should have been shut down much earlier.

Since all related tasks are private, my questions for comms are

* Did we reach out to Science Feedback and ask them to sevisit their fact
check rating?

* |f not, did we reach out to Science Feedback and ‘remind’ them of our
policies shortly before they removed the fact check label?

if not, did we remove the fact check label on the Daily Wire article internally?
Or did Science Feedback remove the label with no intervention from FB
whatsoever, both direct and indirect?

Like Reply  42v fite o

Third question is the most important. Article says:

Facebook and the executive director of Science Feedback deny that
Facebook pushed Science Feedback to remove the "partly false”
rating

So it doesn't sound like the 3PFC removed it.

a \s this true?? If so, what is our explanation?? “Internal Facebook documents
obtained by Popular Information reveal that, prior to the removal of the fact
check, Science Feedback's fact-check of The Daily Wire article was brought to
the attention of top Facebook executives including VP of Global Affairs and
Communications Nick Clegg, VP of Global News Partnerships Campbell Brown,
and VP of Global Public Policy Joel Kaplan. The documents also show that
Facebook was asked by Congressman Mike Johnson (R-LA), a power ful member
of Republican leadership, to reverse the fact-check."

on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on

a Here is a recent example from last week of a fact-check being biased:
https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/bIm-terrorist-rosenberg/

The explanation in the abstract boils down to the claim that the word
"terrorism" has no fixed meaning, and therefore that the claim being
checked is mixed between true and false, which is nonsense.

If Snopes wanted to split hairs, it could argue: the organizations in question
were insurrectionist in nature, but not terrorist, and that there is a distinction
to be made between these categories. Or it could argue: the organization
was terrorist in nature, but the individual was never individually convicted of
terrorism, only of other crimes in service to a terrorist organization. Or it
could argue: the individual was a terrorist and was also convicted, but was
never convicted of terrorism. Or it could argue: the terrorism thing is long in
the past and the individual today is vastly different from the individual then,
and has since renounced political violence.

However, the last paragraph of the fact-check is: "As such, a supportable
(though not definitive) case exists for claiming that the crimes of which
[she] was convicted [...] were indeed acts of domestic terrorism."

So the fact-check abstract is: that words don't have meanings, and
therefore the claim being checked should be rated as mixed between true
and false. And the fact-check conclusion is: that a claim was made which
Snopes believes to be supportable but not definitive, and therefore the
claim should be rated as mixed between true and false.

One demands an understanding of precise methodologies and
knowledge of prior research and the other does not.

My point is he can have his opinion but his opinion doesn’t make it a
debate among scientists as he is not one. Just like he can have an
opinion on COVID but his opinion would not make it a debate among
virologists (and we'd remove it for harmful misinformation)

Yes, software engineering does indeed demand an
understanding of precise methodologies and knowledge of prior
research - we spend a lot of time on this in school. But actually, so
does science.

Neither field requires credentials. The opinions of commentators in
either field are worthwhile based only on the level of relevant
knowledge and skill which inform the opinions. Whether the persons’
backgrounds conform to the expectations of gatekeepers (e.g. having
no formal education in the subject) is immaterial except as a quick-
and-dirty means of taking a first guess at their level of relevant
knowledge and skill.

Popular Information on 3PFC Escalations

Over the past several months, reporter Judd Legum at Popular Information has questioned the
independence of our third-party fact-checking program, our approach to opinion content, and
scrutinized our relationships with publishers - particularly as they relate to climate change
misinformation. This morning Judd ran another story, this time focused on why and how a fact-
check on a climate change piece was reversed only for the conservative publisher the Daily
Wire and not the other conservative publications that also ran the piece.

=

For clarity: in this case, our science-focused fact-checking partner Science Feedback
independently reviewed appeals and, when The Daily Wire added a link to the fact-check from
their article, Science Feedback decided to remove its Partly False rating. Facebook did not
weigh in, which both Science Feedback and Facebook confirmed for the reporter.

Judd's reporting is based off of a leaked escalation note that was sent to leadership. As with
all leaks, this one is discouraging. In this case, the team sent an FYI only note to leadership
since we expected press coverage and wanted leaders to be aware of how we were managing
the situation. What was made clear in the note, even though Judd did not cite it in his story, is
that fact-checkers have discretion on what and how to rate and that appeals processes are run
independent from us.

a ae... honestly not obvious to me (and even less obvious when

we're talking about vaccine misinformation, the other category where we
take a harder line than climate). According to the same kind of global
experts we defer to on COVID-19 and vaccines, climate change is already
causing harm today, so the threat is immediate from that perspective.

 

if the argument is that it's not immediate because today's harm is caused by
carbon that was released many years ago (and the carbon being released
today will cause harm in the future), then we get into a philosophical (but
important!) debate about what immediate means and if it's the right criteria
for taking a threat seriously. The cause of the harm (carbon emissions) is
happening immediately (now), and it immediately begins to change the
climate, and the effects are very difficult if not impossible to reverse once
set in motion. The fact that climate change is happening "slowly" from a
human perspective does not mean it's not an immediate and urgent threat.
