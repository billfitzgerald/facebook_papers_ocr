FULL TEXT
Ms. Thorning-Schmidt, -

In the four years you served Denmark as Prime Minister, you saw the effects of CO2 on climate
change first hand. You made this dire challenge central to your tenure; you took action and
asked other leaders to do the same. You made bold and ambitious commitments to achieve
100% renewable energy. You were celebrated for affirming the urgent necessity of acting to
halt climate change.

Above all, you told the world that climate change is not “an opinion.” It is fact.

Facebook is allowing the spread of climate misinformation to flourish, unchecked, across the
globe. Instead of heeding the advice of independent scientists and approved fact-checkers
from Climate Feedback, Facebook sided with fossil fuel lobbyists by allowing the CO2 Coalition
to take advantage of a giant loophole for “opinion” content. The loophole has allowed climate

denial to fester by labeling it “opinion,” and thus, avoiding the platform's fact-checking
processes.

Facebook knows how to take action against misinformation. When COVID-19 denial took hold
on the platform, it was forcibly shut down because Facebook understood that the spread of
COVID-19 misinformation could cause imminent physical harm to the health and well-being of
Facebook users. Climate denial and misinformation are also deadly. By allowing climate
misinformation to go unchecked, Facebook is actively putting the health and well-being of our
nation’s most vulnerable low-income communities and communities of color at risk.

You and the Oversight Board must step in and enact the same standard for the denial of
climate change as you did for COVID-19 misinformation.

The integrity of the Oversight Board is at risk. Mark Zuckerberg has refused to recognize that

he must get the facts right on climate, and refused to acknowledge that climate denial on his
platform is as dangerous a threat to future generations as any.

We are asking you to lead the charge to fix this. Until Facebook takes a stand, climate denial

groups such as the CO2 Coalition will continue to exploi i

misinformation practice, our plea is grave: please, Ms. Thorning-Schmidt, take action now.

Is there something wrong with us having an open platform where people can post
arguments for either side of an issue and then people make up their own minds
for themselves?

If there’s a group that wants to post the earth is flat, should they not be allowed
to? If people want to post about the story of creation from the Old Testament,
should it be censored because science says evolution occurred otherwise? The
list could go on and on...

Like 45w

Not if false information gets out of control and causes significant harm.
Like 45 Edited Os5

false is relative when everyone cherry picks their
numbers. And having/espousing a different view on climate change is
not causing significant physical harm.

Like 45w

Anthropogenic climate change is causing real harm, and beliefs to the
contrary perpetuate it, increasing harm further because it discourages

the large scale action we need by politicians who listen to the people,
however misinformed their opinions.

There is a discussion to be had, but if a third party fact checker says
something is wrong or misleading, we need to take action, and there is
nothing wrong with pointing folks to high quality information, like we
do with voting.

The third party fact checker for that article was by people that do
climate change work for a living. While they have’§ood experience
maybe, they also have a conflict of interest in that they make their
livings arguing the opposite viewpoint.

If anthropomorphic climate change is doing real harm then should we
ban or censor all who engage in it? Should we cut out advertising for
the major corporations that contribute to it since they are doing
significant physical harm to people?

I'm not arguing the effects of climate change. | simply think that an
open forum for discussion allows for education on the matter. And that
you educate, not censor, to create real, lasting, and meaningful

change in people and society.

The big money is in the status quo - | bet most respected climate

This is the issue being highlighted - the side of climate change denial is
presenting their argument using misinformation. If people make up their
minds based on this misinformation, then they've been manipulated into a
potentially incorrect decision.

As an Environmental Program Manager, can you explain why you've

* If not, did we reach out to Science Feedback and 'remind' them of our

Third question is the most important. Article says:

obtained by Popular Information reveal that, prior to the removal of the fact-
check, Science Feedback's fact-check of The Daily Wire article was brought to
the attention of top Facebook executives including VP of Global Affairs and
Communications Nick Clegg, VP of Global News Partnerships Campbell Brown,
and VP of Global Public Policy Joel Kaplan. The documents also show that
Facebook was asked by Congressman Mike Johnson (R-LA), a powerful member
of Republican leadership, to reverse the fact-check."

“The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared
by 90%-100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent
studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the
97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based
on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on

The explanation in the abstract boils down to the claim that the word
"terrorism" has no fixed meaning, and therefore that the claim being
checked is mixed between true and false, which is nonsense.

If Snopes wanted to split hairs, it could argue: the organizations in question
were insurrectionist in nature, but not terrorist, and that there is a distinction
to be made between these categories. Or it could argue: the organization
was terrorist in nature, but the individual was never individually convicted of
terrorism, only of other crimes in service to a terrorist organization. Or it
could argue: the individual was a terrorist and was also convicted, but was
never convicted of terrorism. Or it could argue: the terrorism thing is long in
the past and the individual today is vastly different from the individual then,
and has since renounced political violence.

However, the last paragraph of the fact-check is: "As such, a supportable
(though not definitive) case exists for claiming that the crimes of which
[she] was convicted [...] were indeed acts of domestic terrorism."

So the fact-check abstract is: that words don't have meanings, and
therefore the claim being checked should be rated as mixed between true
and false. And the fact-check conclusion is: that a claim was made which
Snopes believes to be supportable but not definitive, and therefore the
claim should be rated as mixed between true and false.

Thats a straw man argument comparing two very different professions.
One demands an understanding of precise methodologies and
knowledge of prior research and the other does not.

My point is he can have his opinion but his opinion doesn’t make it a
debate among scientists as he is not one. Just like he can have an
opinion on COVID but his opinion would not make it a debate among
virologists (and we'd remove it for harmful misinformation)

a... software engineering does indeed demand an
understanding of precise methodologies and knowledge of prior

research - we spend a lot of time on this in school. But actually, so
does science.

Neither field requires credentials. The opinions of commentators in
either field are worthwhile based only on the level of relevant
knowledge and skill which inform the opinions. Whether the persons’
backgrounds conform to the expectations of gatekeepers (e.g. having
no formal education in the subject) is immaterial except as a quick-
and-dirty means of taking a first guess at their level of relevant
knowledge and skill.

Popular Information on 3PFC Escalations

Over the past several months, reporter Judd Legum at Popular Information has questioned the
independence of our third-party fact-checking program, our approach to opinion content, and
scrutinized our relationships with publishers - particularly as they relate to climate change
misinformation. This morning Judd ran another story, this time focused on why and how a fact-
check on a climate change piece was reversed only for the conservative publisher the Daily
Wire and not the other conservative publications that also ran the piece.

For clarity: in this case, our science-focused fact-checking partner Science Feedback
independently reviewed appeals and, when The Daily Wire added a link to the fact-check from
their article, Science Feedback decided to remove its Partly False rating. Facebook did not
weigh in, which both Science Feedback and Facebook confirmed for the reporter.

Judd's reporting is based off of a leaked escalation note that was sent to leadership. As with
all leaks, this one is discouraging. In this case, the team sent an FYI only note to leadership
since we expected press coverage and wanted leaders to be aware of how we were managing
the situation. What was made Clear in the note, even though Judd did not cite it in his story, is
that fact-checkers have discretion on what and how to rate and that appeals processes are run
independent from us.

Clarifying our approach to climate change misinformation

This story also touches on our approach to climate change misinformation, which has been
mischaracterized in the press over the past couple of weeks. Our fact-checkers can and do
rate climate science content - there has never been a prohibition against doing so.
Nevertheless, there's been a suggestion that we have an “opinion loophole,” which is allowing

climate change deniers to promote their content on our platform unchecked - this is not
accurate. -

Since we launched our program in 2016, the focus has been on fact-checking verifiable
assertions of fact vs. opinion content. We do not consider climate change, or any topic,
opinion by definition. Simply labeling a piece of content as an op-ed or editorial does not make
it ineligible for fact-checking. This is not and has never been the case. Last week we updated
our Help Center to make it clearer that "content presented as opinion but based on underlying
false information may still be eligible for rating." This reflects what we've shared with our fact-
checkers verbally previously. We are continuing to work to make this clearer going forward.

a a... honestly not obvious to me (and even less obvious when

we're talking about vaccine misinformation, the other category where we
take a harder line than climate). According to the same kind of global
experts we defer to on COVID-19 and vaccines, climate change is already
causing harm today, so the threat is immediate from that perspective.

If the argument is that it's not immediate because today's harm is caused by
carbon that was released many years ago (and the carbon being released
today will cause harm in the future), then we get into a philosophical (but
important!) debate about what immediate means and if it's the right criteria
for taking a threat seriously. The cause of the harm (carbon emissions) is
happening immediately (now), and it immediately begins to change the
climate, and the effects are very difficult if not impossible to reverse once
set in motion. The fact that climate change is happening "slowly" from a
human perspective does not mean it's not an immediate and urgent threat.
